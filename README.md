Day one of HashiConf Europe had lots of exciting updates. The BIG news is #Terraform is finally 1.0! It has been a long journey to get here, but we are super excited for the milestone, and with that the long term support and stability.

We also announced major updates to Terraform Cloud today:
* Workspace Overview. New visualizations for terraform applies, rich READMEs, details of resources and outputs of workspaces.
* Private Module Curation. Import modules from the public Terraform registry into your private registry for curated internal use.
* Run Checks. Webhook based integrations allow you to use external services between plan and apply. Partnering with folks like Bridgecrew Snyk Infracost and more.
